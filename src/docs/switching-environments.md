# Interact with Power Platform Environments

Copilot makes it easier and faster to switch between environments in Power Platform and apply same filters across different environments. In example below, I have two environments, one DevTools and the other one is ProDov. I ask to list environments published by Microsoft but then I ask to execute same query in ProDov environment. Copilot will automatically switch to ProDov environment and execute the query.
