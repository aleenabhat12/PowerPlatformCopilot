# Assign Roles

It has never been easier to assign roles in Power Platform with the help of Copilot.
By merely inputting your coworker's first name and verifying their role, you can seamlessly assign roles to your team members.
For example, enter first name, confirm the role and you are done. Or continue requesting Copilot to delegate more roles to additional individuals as needed.
